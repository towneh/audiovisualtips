# Streaming Tips
Best practices guide for all things getting video and audio in your live event production and virtual spaces.

This document was created following years of trial and error, from running virtual events, and feedback provided from multiple DJs that stream regularly to VR platforms.

## Required Streaming Software

First thing you need is an up to date release version of OBS Studio. For the purpose of production stability I would advise against beta releases where possible.

* [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)
* [Virtual Cable & VoiceMeeter?](https://vb-audio.com/index.htm) *I didn't forget this, not required for streaming since [28.0 release](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/28.0.0#:~:text=Added%20application%20audio%20capture) UNLESS using Multi-channel 5.1*
* Access to a video delivery platform, such as Twitch.tv, VRCDN or you own hosted.
